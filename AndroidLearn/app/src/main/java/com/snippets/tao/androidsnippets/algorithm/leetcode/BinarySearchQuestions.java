     * Binary Search
     *
     * Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.
     *
     * You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

     * Example 1:
     *
     * Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
     * Output: 4
     * Explanation: 9 exists in nums and its index is 4
     * Example 2:
     *
     * Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2
     * Output: -1
     * Explanation: 2 does not exist in nums so return -1
     *
     *
     * Constraints:
     *
     * 1 <= nums.length <= 104
     * -104 < nums[i], target < 104
     * All the integers in nums are unique.
     * nums is sorted in ascending order.
